# Implement Plan Command

## Purpose

Execute a plan systematically, phase by phase, with verification at each step.

## Instructions

When given a plan file or description:

1. **Load the plan** from the specified path or find the most recent relevant plan

2. **Create a todo list** from the plan phases

3. **For each phase**:
   - Announce which phase you're starting
   - Implement all changes for that phase
   - Run automated verification commands
   - Report results
   - Update checkboxes in the plan
   - Handle any blockers by:
     - Clearly explaining the issue
     - Suggesting resolution steps
     - Pausing for user input if needed

4. **After each phase**:
   - Summarize what was completed
   - Show verification results
   - Confirm before proceeding to next phase (if configured)

5. **On completion**:
   - Summarize all changes made
   - List any manual verification needed
   - Suggest next steps
