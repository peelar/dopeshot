# Create Plan Command

## Purpose

Generate detailed, phased implementation plans with clear success criteria.

## Instructions

When the user describes a feature or change:

1. **Research phase** (if needed):
   - Check existing research in `thoughts/research/`
   - Conduct additional research if gaps exist

2. **Generate a structured plan** with:
   - Overview explaining the approach
   - Why this approach was chosen
   - 3-5 implementation phases
   - Each phase includes:
     - Specific file changes with locations
     - Code examples where helpful
     - Automated verification commands
     - Manual verification checklist

3. **Success criteria for each phase**:
   - Automated checks (tests, build, lint, types)
   - Manual verification steps
   - Rollback considerations

4. **Save the plan** to `thoughts/plans/[descriptive_name].md`
