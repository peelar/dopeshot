# Research Codebase Command

## Purpose

Deep dive into the codebase using parallel analysis to understand how specific systems work.

## Instructions

When the user provides a research question, you will:

1. **Spawn parallel research agents** to investigate different aspects:
   - **Codebase Locator**: Find all relevant files, modules, and directories
   - **Codebase Analyzer**: Understand how the code works, data flows, and dependencies
   - **Pattern Finder**: Discover coding patterns, conventions, and best practices to follow

2. **For each agent, investigate**:
   - File locations with specific line numbers
   - Code patterns and their purposes
   - Dependencies and relationships
   - Edge cases and error handling

3. **Synthesize findings** into a comprehensive research document:
   - Overview of the system
   - Key files and their responsibilities
   - Patterns to follow
   - Potential concerns or complexity
   - Recommendations for implementation

4. **Save the research** to `thoughts/research/[descriptive_name].md`
